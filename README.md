# Alternate Frontend for Udemy "NestJS Zero to Hero" by Ariel Weinberger

Check out [the course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/101ZIcAEUad1hTQH4F/), it's a very gently presented and enlightening intro to [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/).

Later on in the course Ariel provides a frontend, that isn't the subject of the course, but allows you to interact with the REST service, that is the main subject.

I found it required Python-2 to install üêç and üò±, and I also wanted to learn more about [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) not because the name is so similar with NestJS, but because the people at Vercel seem to be incredibly smart. ([Case in point, SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/))

I tried to keep most of the code similar with Ariel's frontend, but this does have a few changes,
* the router is taken out of MobX and the NextJS router is used instead (it's a core part of their platform)
* the way the pages are set up is also different, also due to NextJS platform architecture
* I didn't really think RxJS was necessary in the create-task form, when a `useEffect` is all it seems to need
* Updated usage of MobX to avoid any warnings - coming from Redux that is a bit of a paradigm shift, and there are a lot of different version APIs to React/MobX.

Updated!
* Now with hooks based API
* Restful frontend API endpoints
* CORS is handled by the frontend - no need to write `app.enableCors()` in the service, although it won't hurt anything either.
